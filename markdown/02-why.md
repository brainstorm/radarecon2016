** why am I here in 3 steps **

1. A thing I own stopped working. I **wanted to know why**.
2. I inquired @trufae on radare's ARMv5 and AVR support.
3. Got ~~entangled~~ **involved** into this ~~mess~~ **fantastic community**.

Note:
I **DO NOT** think drones are specially cool toys.
I just like to solve interesting problems. 

Reversing == Awesome brain gymnastics.
